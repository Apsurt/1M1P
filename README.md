### One Month One Project 
<p align="justify">New year new me as they say. I decided to overcome my greatest problem which is low attention span. 1M1P is my initiative to help me staying consistent working on one project for a month. <b>No more, no less</b>. I am doing it both for fun, self-development, self-discipline and as a creativity part of my CAS. There is one condition when i can start new project. When I will complete all goals that I will set at the beggining.</p>
